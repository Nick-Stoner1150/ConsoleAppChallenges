# ConsoleAppChallenges

## Komodo Cafe
Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, 
delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.

In this project I had to create a MENU Item Class with properties, constructors, and fields. 
Then, I crated a Menu Item Repository to save all menu items. I created a Unit Test for each method in my repository.
Lastly, I created a UI so the Cafe Manager could add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.

## Komodo Claims Department 
In this Console App, I created a Claim class with properties, constructors, and other fields to be able to create and capture new insurance claims. 
I also created a Claims repository to store the claim information. I also created a unit test to test my methods in the claim repository 
The UI allows the user to add a claim, peek the next claim in the queue, and remove it as necessary. 

## Badges
In this app, I created something a little different. A dictionary repository! I had to create a badge class in order to keep track of Komo Insurance employees badge access to certain
doors. I created a Unit Test to test each method in my repository and the UI allowed the user to create badge and its access, update any doors the badge had access to, and delete any doors
the user had access to. Lastly, the user could see a list of all badges and the doors they had access to.
